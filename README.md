As we know health is wealth, all of us try to be fit and disease-free. But now-a-days the expanses of medications are too much and even sometime we need some help from others as their nobel contributions wehever needed.
There are so many NGOs there for helping but if we can raise some funds from indivisuals also, the estimated target can be fulfilled within very short span of time.
In the age of globalization, we are slightly moving towards the cryptocurrencies. So the application Helpify-Me is based on ethereum blockchain where we can contribute the currency (ether) to the funds that are created by any person.

The application is deployed to the rinkeby test network.
